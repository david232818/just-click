# just-click

## Brief story of just click
Just click was the last assignment of C lecture I heard when I was a freshman. In 2018, I solved it by using termios functions because I could not found a function for nonblocking mouse input in ncurses library. But in 2023, I reviewed this problem and found nodelay function. And for now, I found mouseinterval function which can control click resolution. So all of the solutions I struggled, was in the ncurses library after all.
